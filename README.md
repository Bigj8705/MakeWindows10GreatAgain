# MakeWindows10GreatAgain
Tweaks to make Windows 10 less annoying and more usable.

I get tired of applying the same changes over and over when I reformat my Windows box, so I figured I'd package the common changes that I make into a script. 

Here's what this script does:

1. Disables Cortana
2. Disables Notification Center
3. Disables automatic reboots after Windows Updates have been installed
4. Disables Microsoft.com accounts from Windows Login
5. Shows file extenstions for known file types
6. Sets Explorer to open to "This PC" when a new window is opened
7. Shows hidden files (not including OS files)
8. Disables inline ads/notifications for OneDrive
9. Shows "This PC" icon on Desktop
10. Enables developer mode (required for Linux Subsystem)
